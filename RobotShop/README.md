## Lab Goals

Practice creating and using a Python class, including constructing instances
and calling methods.

### Skills Acquired/Reinforced Upon Completion

- Define a class with methods and instance variables.
- Create objects by calling the class constructor.
- Use objects by using the interface provided by the methods.

## Non-Object-Oriented base program

In this lab, you will refactor an existing program to use an object-oriented
style instead of separate, coordinated lists of strings and numbers.

The tasks completed are:

1. First, define a `Product` class that includes all the information about a single product.
  <br>  a. A constructor to make objects of this class which have three instance variables: name, price, and quantity in-stock.
  <br> b. A method to the class that takes an integer count and determines whether that many of the product are in stock.
  <br> c. Another method that takes a count and returns the total cost of that many of
        the product.
    d. A method that takes a count and removes that many of the product from the stock.
2. Able to modify the objects according to the transactions taken place
